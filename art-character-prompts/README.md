# Random Character Generator // Creation Station
A site for character generation. Whether it be in devising inspiration for drawing, or for a story persona- from a robotic elf to a happy gnome with light magic, Creation Station is there to help in your artistic planning.

## Why ?
This was inspired by trends where people give prompts for how a certain character will be constructed. An example of the trend would be: 
    "If you have siblings, your character will have wings; if you're an only child then your character will have a tail."

Plus, sometimes when I'm drawing I want to draw something new that I haven't drawn yet but I'm not quite sure what else I should include... so I end up drawing maybe 5 heads and some flowers and then call it a day. So I made this site with the hopes to help inspire myself, and anyone else who might come across it.
